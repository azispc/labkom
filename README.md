Computer users in Indonesia are increasing in various industries such as corporate offices, schools and others. Many schools from junior high school to college are required to have computer lab for their students. To develop a computer lab, a technician is required to make configuration on each computer uniformly and can simplify in updating such as renewal and so on. Installation and configuration on the computer lab require a management, so that on a large scale can be done easily and quickly. Lab installation and configuration management are mostly done manually so it tends to require more resources and a long time to produce uniformity of computer configuration results. In the research, we will apply the installation and configuration management using one of the method of deployment management that is SaltStack. SaltStack is an automated software for infrastructure management built on dynamic communication buses. SaltStack can be used for remote execution for any infrastructure and configuration management for any app stack
